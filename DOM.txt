The window object is a global object in JavaScript that represents the browser window or the environment in which the script is running. It is the top-level object in the Document Object Model (DOM) hierarchy and serves as a global namespace for all JavaScript code running in a web page.

Key Features of the window Object:

Global Scope:
All global variables and functions declared in JavaScript are properties or methods of the window object.
  
Access to the DOM:
The window object provides access to the document object, which represents the content of the web page.

NOTE =>> The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a web page as a hierarchical tree of objects, allowing scripts like JavaScript to interact with and manipulate the content, structure, and styles of a web page.
         The DOM is an abstract model of the document structure.
         Tree Structure: The DOM is organized as a tree of nodes, where each node represents a part of the document (like an element, attribute, or text).

BOM =>> The BOM (Browser Object Model) is a programming interface provided by web browsers that allows JavaScript to interact with the browser itself, outside the scope of the webpage content. It provides objects, methods, and properties to interact with the browser window and control things like the browser's history, location, and more.
It provides functionality to interact with the browser environment.

=> Core Objects of the BOM:                        
window: Represents the browser window.
navigator: Provides information about the browser and operating system.
location: Represents the current URL of the browser window and allows navigation.
history: Gives access to the browser's session history and allows navigation through it.
