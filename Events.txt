Events in JavaScript are actions or occurrences that happen in the browser, such as a user clicking a button, hovering over an element, pressing a key, or when the page loads.
JavaScript provides a robust event-handling system to listen for and respond to these events.

Event Listeners:
const btn = document.querySelector("button");
btn.addEventListener("click", () => {
    alert("Button clicked!");
});

Inline Event Handling:
<button onclick="alert('Button clicked!')">Click Me</button>

Using on<Event> Properties:
const button = document.querySelector("button");
button.onclick = function () {
    alert("Button clicked!");
};
