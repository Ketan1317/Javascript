1. Polyfills:
What are Polyfills?
A polyfill is a piece of code (usually a library or script) that provides backward compatibility for newer JavaScript features in environments where they are not natively supported.

How Polyfills Work:
They detect whether a specific feature exists in the current environment.
If not, they add a custom implementation of that feature.2. Transpilers

2. Transpilers:
What are Transpilers?
A transpiler is a tool that converts modern JavaScript (ES6+ or TypeScript) into an older version of JavaScript (e.g., ES5) so it can run in environments that do not support the latest features.

How Transpilers Work:
They parse the code written in modern JavaScript syntax.
They transform the code into an equivalent, older version of JavaScript.

Examples of Transpilers:
TypeScript Compiler (tsc): Converts TypeScript to JavaScript.


Summary
Polyfills add missing APIs at runtime.
Transpilers rewrite modern syntax into older syntax at build time.
Together, they ensure compatibility across all browsers and environments, enabling developers to use the latest JavaScript features without worrying about compatibility issues.
