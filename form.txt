=> Form navigation:

document.forms =>
A form is available as document.forms[name/index].

form.elements =>
Form elements are available as form.elements[name/index], or can use just form[name/index]. 
The elements property also works for <fieldset>.

element.form =>
Elements reference their form in the form property.

Value is available as input.value, textarea.value, select.value, etc. (For checkboxes and radio buttons, use input.checked to determine whether a value is selected.)


==>> Events focus/blur <<==
The focus event is called on focusing, and blur – when the element loses the focus.

Let’s use them for validation of an input field.

In the example below:

The blur handler checks if the field has an email entered, and if not – shows an error.
The focus handler hides the error message (on blur it will be checked again):
